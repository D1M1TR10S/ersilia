  Privacy-preserving AI/ML options are necessary to promote data sharing at the
  interface between private and public stakeholders in drug discovery
---

# Motivation

As the drug discovery industry is moving towards collaborative ventures and private-public partnerships, there is an urge for **data sharing** solutions that do not compromise the intellectual property of the companies. The current project offers an innovative approach to this problem. We are requesting funding to support one software engineer and the cloud-computing costs associated with the development of the encrypted AI/ML tool.
