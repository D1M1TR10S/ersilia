# Motivation

## Privacy preserving AI/ML for drug discovery

We are developing an open-source **privacy-preserving machine learning platform** for drug discovery. It has been widely argued that artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) can transform the pharmaceutical industry. However, AI/ML techniques are bound to the availability of training datasets, oftentimes restricted by intellectual property (IP) liabilities. As a result, a wealth of proprietary experimental screening results remains inaccessible to researchers and impossible to share without compromising the IP of the companies.

The current project offers a solution to this problem. We propose that **sensitive experimental results can be shared securely in the form of AI/ML models**, which retain the essential properties of the dataset but do not display the identity of the screened compounds. Sharing encrypted AI/ML tools instead of datasets may enable new forms of collaboration between pharma, biotech and academia, and offers a new means of contribution to Open Science.
