# Communication

## Work Environment

EOSI’s team is composed of mission-driven individuals from diverse backgrounds, cultures and life experiences. The diversity is what makes EOSI unique, each individual is encouraged to bring its personal touch to the community. We favour remote working and flexibility, without losing collaborative energy. Asynchronous work happens regularly via Slack and team calls are organised weekly to ensure communication and support!

## Communication

Ersilia’s main communication channel is Slack. Our Slack community is composed of people actively participating in any capacity in EOSI’s mission. We ask all participants to adhere to our code of conduct and interact respectfully with our peers. If you wish to join our Slack community, message us at hello@ersilia.io and we will send you the link. Additionally, coding-related issues will be discussed via GitHub, to make them visible to the broader community (see below). Finally, we are always reachable via email. We aim to respond to all enquiries within 3 working days. In addition to EOSI’s Slack workspace, we are lucky to be part of a larger network of aligned organisations. This includes Code for Science and Society, Fast Forward, the Software Sustainability Institute, and the Open Life Sciences program. As part of EOSI, you are welcome to reach out to those communities via us.

## Tech stack

* GitHub: all our code lives on GitHub. Each project is associated with a repository on our [GitHub orgainzation page](https://github.com/ersilia-os/). We strongly encourage contributors to work as openly as possible, sharing the code daily to facilitate interaction and reproducibility. For code-related issues, bugs, etc., we prefer hosting the conversations on the “issues” section of the relevant GitHub repository, where all the community can see it and provide input. Once you start working with us, we will assign you a member or collaborator role in the organization. If you are not familiar with working in collaboration via GitHub, we recommend checking some starter guides beforehand, or joining a Carpentries or any other open training program.&#x20;
* GitBook. We benefit from a pro-bono plan on GitBook, where we develop all documentation related to our tools.&#x20;
* Microsoft Visual Studio Code: this is our preferred code editor. Most of our software is written in Python and runs in UNIX and MacOS. We recommend installing a Windows Subsystem for Linux on Windows machines to avoid compatibility issues.&#x20;
* Monday.com: we use Monday.com as project management and task tracker. We would like to the extent that this is possible that our collaborators use this tool to update the team on project progress.&#x20;
* AirTable: AirTable is the backend of our website and hosts relevant information for social media and other content. Unless you are joining us for marketing-related activities, you do not need to worry about it.&#x20;
* Softr: We use Softr as a no-code platform to develop our website.&#x20;
* Google Workspace: we benefit from the non-profit Google Workspace. Our meetings happen via Google Meet and our files repository is Google Drive.&#x20;
* AWS: our cloud system is currently in development on the AWS servers.

## Outreach

We use Twitter ([@ersiliaio](https://twitter.com/ersiliaio)) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ersiliaio/) as our main outreach channels. Both Gemma ([@TuronGemma](https://twitter.com/TuronGemma)) and Miquel ([@mduranfrigola](https://twitter.com/mduranfrigola)) are active on Twitter.
