# Model selection

## Roadmap of the Ersilia Model Hub

The goal of Ersilia is to create the reference resource of AI/ML models for biomedical research, with a focus on drug discovery for infectious and neglected tropical diseases that affect the Global South.

We have planned the growth of the [Ersilia Model Hub](https://ersilia.io/model-hub) as follows:

* **Phase 1:** Chemistry centered models.
* **Phase 2:** Protein-centered models.
* **Phase 3:** Protein-chemical interaction models.
* **Phase 4:** Cell- and pathogen-based models.
* **Phase 5:** Clinical and epidemiology models.

Within each face, we find models of three types:

* **Type A:**&#x20;
* **Type B:**&#x20;
* **Type C:**

We have planned the growth of the Ersilia Model Hub as follows:

\


Phase 1: Chemistry-centered models

\


\


Phase 2: Protein-centered models

\


\


Phase 3: Protein-chemical interaction models

\


\


Phase 4: Cell- and pathogen-based models

\


\


Phase 5: Clinical and epidemiology models

\


\


Within each Phase, we can define three Stages:

\


1. Models developed by third parties

\


B. Models developed by Ersilia using publicly available data

\


C. Models developed by Ersilia using collaboratorâ€™s data

\


In other words, we can categorize models:
