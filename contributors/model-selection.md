# Model selection

## Selecting models for the Ersilia Model Hub

### Roadmap

The goal of Ersilia is to create the reference resource of AI/ML models for biomedical research, with a focus on drug discovery for infectious and neglected tropical diseases that affect the Global South.

We have planned the growth of the [Ersilia Model Hub](https://ersilia.io/model-hub) as follows:

* **Phase 1:** Chemistry centered models.
* **Phase 2:** Protein-centered models.
* **Phase 3:** Protein-chemical interaction models.
* **Phase 4:** Cell- and pathogen-based models.
* **Phase 5:** Clinical and epidemiology models.

Within each face, we find models of three types:

* **Type A:** Models developed by others. ****&#x20;
* **Type B:** Models developed by Ersilia based on publicly available data.
* **Type C:** Models developed by Ersilia based on data from collaborators.

{% hint style="info" %}
Ersilia does not follow this roadmap strictly. Since we are already involved in [several projects and collaborations](https://ersilia.io/projects), the Ersilia Model Hub grows in an organic way, necessarily. For example, while we are mainly focused on Phase 1, Type A models at the moment, we spend a lot of time on Phase 1, Type C models, for example as a result of our collaboration with H3D at the University of Cape Town.
{% endhint %}

### Types of models

In other words, we can categorize models

* By input:
  * XX
  * XX
  * XX
* By source
  * XX
  * XX
  * XX

We estimate that, only in Phase 1.A, we will be able to include at least 200 SOTA models. At the end of Phase 1.A, we will write a scientific publication and submit it for peer review.

### Where to find models?

* Scientific literature ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com))
* Code repositories (mainly [GitHub](https://github.com))
* Other model hubs such as [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co), [TensorFlow Hub](https://tensorflow.org/hub), [PyTorch Hub](https://pytorch.org/hub), etc.
* [Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/)
* Benchmarks, competitions and leaderboards: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [DREAM Challenges](https://dreamchallenges.org/), [Therapeutic Data Commons](https://tdcommons.ai/), etc.
* Twitter: [@KevinKaichuang](https://twitter.com/KevinKaichuang), [@andrewwhite01](https://twitter.com/andrewwhite01)
* Ersilia Slack workspace: the `#literature` channel
* Ersilia models backlog spreadsheet

### Topic of the week

Every **Monday by 2pm CET**, one person of the team will suggest one topic and the rest of us will prioritize model search about this topic during the week. Topics can be related to a task of biomedical relevance, or to a particular family of algorithms. Valid topics could be:

By biomedical relevance:

* Antimalarial activity prediction
* Broad spectrum antibiotic activity prediction
* Drug toxicity prediction
* Synthetic accessibility of compounds

By algorithmic relevance:

* Graph neural networks
* Reinforcement learning methods
* Chemistry language transformer models

#### Announcing the topic of the week

In the Slack `#internships` channel, one person (for example **@Miquel**), will write a message like this:

****:calendar: **@channel** This is the topic of the week!\
:robot: Topic: Antimalarial activity prediction\
:thinking: Why? \
:track\_next: Next: **@Gemma**

In this case, **@Miquel** should pin :pushpin: the message so that everybody can see it during the week.

It would be great if the rest of the **@channel** can make comments, ask questions, or give feedback about the topic choice. Or even just confirm that you've read the message (:raised\_hands:,:thumbsup:,:heart:,...)
