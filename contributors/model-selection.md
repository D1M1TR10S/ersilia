## Selecting models for the Ersilia Model Hub

### Roadmap of the Ersilia Model Hub

The goal of Ersilia is to create the reference resource of AI/ML models for biomedical research, with a focus on drug discovery for infectious and neglected tropical diseases that affect the Global South.

We have planned the growth of the [Ersilia Model Hub](https://ersilia.io/model-hub) as follows:

* **Phase 1:** Chemistry centered models.
* **Phase 2:** Protein-centered models.
* **Phase 3:** Protein-chemical interaction models.
* **Phase 4:** Cell- and pathogen-based models.
* **Phase 5:** Clinical and epidemiology models.

Within each face, we find models of three types:

* **Type A:** Models developed by others. ****&#x20;
* **Type B:** Models developed by Ersilia based on publicly available data.
* **Type C:** Models developed by Ersilia based on data from collaborators.

{% hint style="info" %}
Ersilia does not follow this roadmap strictly. Since we are already involved in [several projects and collaborations](https://ersilia.io/projects), the Ersilia Model Hub grows in an organic way, necessarily. For example, while we are mainly focused on Phase 1, Type A models at the moment, we spend a lot of time on Phase 1, Type C models, for example as a result of our collaboration with H3D at the University of Cape Town.
