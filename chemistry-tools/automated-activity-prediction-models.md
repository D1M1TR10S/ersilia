In order to scale up our modeling capabilities for chemistry datasets, we have developed two Python libraries for automated machine learning (AutoML):

* [LazyQSAR](https://github.com/ersilia-os/lazy-qsar) for baseline modeling.
* [ZairaChem](https://github.com/ersilia-os/zaira-chem) for advanced and more accurate modeling.
