### Automated model training

Key to the success of our enterprise is the **quality** of the AI/ML models developed in-house and in collaboration (points 3 and 4 above). To this aim, we plan to use **AutoML** technologies (e.g. hyperparameter optimization), combined with **in-house feature engineering tools**. In brief, our methodology will build upon an extended version of the [Chemical Checker](https://bioactivitysignatures.org) (CC). The CC encapsulates an unprecedented amount of small molecule data in the form of numerical vectors that can be plugged into any standard AI/ML algorithm. In practice, it offers an ideal scenario for **transfer learning**, since it maps small molecules in their relevant bioactivity space, and only a relatively simple fine-tuning or supervised learning step is necessary to provide state-of-the-art predictive tools. Although the CC was initially designed to deal with human cell line data (especially in the context of cancer and Alzheimerâ€™s research), it is easily extensible to **antimicrobial** and **antiviral** data points. We are currently working in this direction with our collaborators.
