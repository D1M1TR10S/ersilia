# Model selection

## Model List

First, check our [Model Hub Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TQdei8kkF6zMGyDn0km0qmjZb6p-PM9gsBnSWg3637s/edit?usp=sharing), which contains two sheets:

* **Model Hub:** models that are already in the Hub or being incorporated at the moment. Each model should contain accurate information about its usage, source and any other relevant information.
* **Model Suggestions:** Contains a backlog of models that could be of interest to Ersilia. This sheet contains minimal information about the models. There is an _Approved_ and a _Selected_ tickbox. _Approved_ means that Ersilia is willing to incorporate this model. _Selected_ means that someone is already working on the model or the model has been successfully incorporated in the Ersilia Model Hub.

To start contributing:

1. Become a member of the **Ersilia Slack** Workspace. All our communications are centralised there. If you need a sign up link, please email us at hello@ersilia.io
2. Join the **#contributors** channel in Slack and ask for edit permits for the Spreadsheet.
3. Fill in models of interest in the **Model Suggestions** list (if you need some sources of inspiration, check below)
4. Wait for model to be **approved** (or select an already approved one) and notify everyone of your selection on the #contributors channel to avoid duplication.
5. Fill in the information on the Model Hub sheet. Use the next available EOS ID and **do not** modify it.
6. Start coding! Head to the [Model Incorporation Guidelines](model-incorporation.md) for more information.

## Know where to find models and get inspiration

Unfortunately, there is no centralized resource to find AI/ML models for drug discovery online (reason why Ersilia exists). The following resources can help you, though:

* Scientific literature: use [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) and type relevant keywords (e.g. _antimicrobial drug discovery_).
* Reputable scientific journals: identify scientific journals that tend to publish AI/ML research related to drug discovery (e.g. [Chemical Science](https://www.rsc.org/journals-books-databases/about-journals/chemical-science/), [Nature Machine Intelligence](https://www.nature.com/natmachintell/), etc.). Subscribe to their newsletter if you are interested.
* Code repositories (mainly [GitHub](https://github.com)): on a regular Google search, type _github_ next to your keywords for the search.
* Browse other model hubs such as [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co), [TensorFlow Hub](https://tensorflow.org/hub), [PyTorch Hub](https://pytorch.org/hub), etc.
* Expore [Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/). It is a fantastic resource.
* Follow benchmarks, competitions and leaderboards: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [DREAM Challenges](https://dreamchallenges.org/), [Therapeutic Data Commons](https://tdcommons.ai/), etc.
* Use Twitter: follow accounts like [@KevinKaichuang](https://twitter.com/KevinKaichuang), [@andrewwhite01](https://twitter.com/andrewwhite01), [@EricTopol](https://twitter.com/erictopol) and [@janjensen](https://twitter.com/janjensen). From Ersilia ([@ersiliaio](https://twitter.com/ersiliaio), [@mduranfrigola](https://twitter.com/mduranfrigola), [@TuronGemma](https://twitter.com/TuronGemma)) we tend to retweet relevant literature.
* Use the `#literature` channel in the Ersilia Slack workspace to get inspiration.
* Check the models backlog in the [Ersilia Model Hub Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TQdei8kkF6zMGyDn0km0qmjZb6p-PM9gsBnSWg3637s/edit?usp=sharing) to avoid duplications and get inspiration too.
