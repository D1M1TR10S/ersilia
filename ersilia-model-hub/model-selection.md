## Know where to find models and get inspiration

Unfortunately, there is no centralized resource to find AI/ML models for drug discovery online (reason why Ersilia exists). The following resources can help you, though:

* Scientific literature: use [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) and type relevant keywords (e.g. _antimicrobial drug discovery_).
* Reputable scientific journals: identify scientific journals that tend to publish AI/ML research related to drug discovery (e.g. [Chemical Science](https://www.rsc.org/journals-books-databases/about-journals/chemical-science/), [Nature Machine Intelligence](https://www.nature.com/natmachintell/), etc.). Subscribe to their newsletter if you are interested.
* Code repositories (mainly [GitHub](https://github.com)): on a regular Google search, type _github_ next to your keywords for the search.
* Browse other model hubs such as [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co), [TensorFlow Hub](https://tensorflow.org/hub), [PyTorch Hub](https://pytorch.org/hub), etc.
* Expore [Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/). It is a fantastic resource.
* Follow benchmarks, competitions and leaderboards: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [DREAM Challenges](https://dreamchallenges.org/), [Therapeutic Data Commons](https://tdcommons.ai/), etc.
* Use Twitter: follow accounts like [@KevinKaichuang](https://twitter.com/KevinKaichuang), [@andrewwhite01](https://twitter.com/andrewwhite01), [@EricTopol](https://twitter.com/erictopol) and [@janjensen](https://twitter.com/janjensen). From Ersilia ([@ersiliaio](https://twitter.com/ersiliaio), [@mduranfrigola](https://twitter.com/mduranfrigola), [@TuronGemma](https://twitter.com/TuronGemma)) we tend to retweet relevant literature.
* Use the `#literature` channel in the Ersilia Slack workspace to get inspiration.
* Check the models backlog in the [Ersilia Model Hub Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TQdei8kkF6zMGyDn0km0qmjZb6p-PM9gsBnSWg3637s/edit?usp=sharing) to avoid duplications and get inspiration too.
